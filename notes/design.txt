Divded into 4 parts:

Server Side code in C++ (Old but good)

 Part A-Markov Chain (John/Vince):

1) C++ code that reads a text file into a hashmap with buckets. Each bucket is a struct Word with members string name and int count. 
2) JSON parser potentially
3) C++ code that creates a message of 280 characters or less using a trending word and then the hashmap 


Part B– API Extraction: (Cam/Newton):

1) C++ code Interfacing with twitcurl to create a text file of tweets. 
2) Create a web app in order to use the twitter API and host a web server on ix – C++ backend
