Cleaned up twitcurl_test code, adding a makefile. This is used to ensure the group can all compile and run the code required for the project.

- Discovered need for another library to help parse JSON data.
-https://linux.tips/programming/how-to-install-and-use-json-cpp-library-on-ubuntu-linux-os  link to website for how I installed jsoncpp library (JSON parser library used).
- Successful extraction of text portions from tweets.

2/23
Groups next steps:
	- Integrate twitter extraction module with the Markov chain module to begin roughly forming tweets.

Notes:
	- We have ran into an issue where the Mac users in our group are unable to install the twitcurl library. We are looking for a work around, but we may end up just using Docker to create a virutal environment so that the program can run on everyones computer.


2/24 Week recap: group members worked to get twitcurl library functionality in order to generate a text file of tweets to be used later with a markov chain (Cameron, John, Netwon). 
		 work was also done on the markov chain program. Design was thought out at group meeting. The implementation was started. (John and Vincent). Overall progress seems to be 
		 well underway. Next week will likely see a functional markov chain using the txt file of tweets. Then we will need to get the programs to work cohesively and also send tweets.
