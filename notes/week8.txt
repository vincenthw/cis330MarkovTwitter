Created class twitcurlWrapper to use twitcurl functions and prepare the results so that they can be used by the markov chain generator.
Current functionality of twitcurlWrapper is:
    - search twitter, needs work
    - get tweets by user, basically complete
    - parses results of api calls, returns a string containing all of the tweets combined in to one
    
Not working:
    getTweetByUser() is inconsistent with some usernames, need to check json for errors before parsing
    hashtag search (possible fix in twitcurl pull request https://github.com/swatkat/twitcurl/pull/70)
    search without truncating tweets
    search in general provides poor results due to combination of above

Once the markov chain generator is complete, we can use a twitcurlWrapper object to easily get strings that can be passed into the generator.

Also continued to try to get the code to compile on Mac / other OSs without success

I think I got a docker container working so that anyone can compile and run the code in it. 
Commands to use it:

./dockerCompile

Did a lot of work to get two markov chain constructors to work. Group met and discussed next steps as well as group member roles. Cam and I are going to be working on Markov Chain, John and Newton on twitter api etc., due to the fact that the twitcurl api is not wanting to cooperate on our macs. So far it seems we have made good progress. Meeting again on the weekend, hopefully will be making tweets soon!

completed  - markovChain(fstream &input)
	   - markovChain(string input)
           - a host of other small things that allow these to work (some operator overloading)
	     string parsing, etc.

Added function to twitcurlWrapper that will check if a given username is valid.
Added function to twitbotDriver to get usernames from user input, and combine those users' tweets into one string to be used in markov chain.
