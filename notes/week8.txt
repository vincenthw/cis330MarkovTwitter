Created class twitcurlWrapper to use twitcurl functions and prepare the results so that they can be used by the markov chain generator.
Current functionality of twitcurlWrapper is:
    - search twitter, needs work
    - get tweets by user, basically complete
    - parses results of api calls, returns a string containing all of the tweets combined in to one
    
Not working:
    hashtag search (possible fix in twitcurl pull request https://github.com/swatkat/twitcurl/pull/70)
    search without truncating tweets
    search in general provides poor results due to combination of above

Once the markov chain generator is complete, we can use a twitcurlWrapper object to easily get strings that can be passed into the generator.

Also continued to try to get the code to compile on Mac / other OSs without success
