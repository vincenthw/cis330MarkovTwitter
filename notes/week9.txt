Held meeting to discuss and research integrating some python code that could call the c++ code we have written. This way we could integrate the webpage and allow it to generate markov sentences and display them to the user.

started git branch for fleshing out the command line interface as a backup way for users to interact with the application. Created a separate cpp file to keep main() clean

3/7 - Newton/Cam (forgot to update notes day of)
Created Html page for displaying the twitter feed and taking in user input to generate tweets. Also began to research how to direct this data to our C++ code so that the tweets can be generated from this data, Node.js looked promising but after a bit of research determined it appeard too complex and would require too much of a re-work of the current code to attempt. Began to look into creating a wrapper so that data could be sent from python to the C++ function, this looks more achieveable.

continued working on cli branch.

3/8 - Newton/Cam
Continued researching creating wrapper for python and began to develop a test implementation. Currently running into errors with the importing of the wrapper, attempting to debug.

3/9
after much time attempting wrappers for python and c++ communication, we implemented a method that allowed python to simply write to a text file the unser inputs from the html which  then using os python commands can run a c++ file within the same python function. Dockerfile has been changed to handle these changes and is now awaiting intagration with master c++ file for a fully working user friendly interface.

Spent several hours adding class functions and now the program generates real sentences! (With almost no grammar). Next step is to link all parts together/merge back to master. Additionally, I will try to add in grammar rules, possibly using text files of nouns, verbs, etc. to create more realisitic sentence syntax.
